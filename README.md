# Hammurabi Python API Wrapper

This repository hosts an API wrapper for a comprehensive database of transaction data for the SOL-USDC pool on Orca, one of the leading decentralized exchanges on the Solana blockchain. The dataset includes detailed information on each transaction, providing valuable insights for traders, analysts, and enthusiasts.

The eventual aim is to expand the database to feature comprehensive coverage of Orca liquidity pool data and eventually provide coverage of additional decentralized exchanges on Solana such as Raydium. However the database is still a work in progress. The API wrapper serves as an easy way for end users to access this database, making DeFi data on Solana more accessible.

## Running On Local Machine 

Accessing the data on your local machine involves several steps. Whether you prefer postman or cURL, the first steps is the same. Ensure that you have Python version 3.9 and the dependencies specified within the requirements.txt file installed. Then, run the application using the following command: 

```python app.py```

#### Postman 

**Generating A New API Key**

A new API key can be generated by: 

- Set request type to 'POST'
- URL: http://localhost:5000/generate_api_key
- Authorization: Basic Auth with admin credentials
- Body: x-www-form-urlencoded, key: tier, value: free

**Changing The API Key's Tier**

To change an API key's tier: 

- Request type 'POST'
- URL: http://localhost:5000/change_tier
- Authorization: Basic Auth with admin credentials
- Body: raw, format: JSON
```
{
  "api_key": "your_api_key",
  "new_tier": "builder"
}
```

**Accessing The Database**

To access data stored in the database, determine if you want to access the raw transaction, price, or metadata data. For example, the price route can be accessed by running the following steps:

- Request type: 'GET'
- URL: http://localhost:5000/prices
- Headers: API-Key, value: <your-API-key>
- Send the request

Similar steps can be taken to access the raw transaction and metadata information. 

#### CURL 

**Generating A New API Key**

To generate a new API key, run the following command: 

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate_api_key -u admin_username:admin_password -d "tier=free"
```

Replace 'admin_username' and 'admin_password' with your actual admin credentials. 

**Changing The API Key's Tier**

The following can be ran to change an API key's tier: 

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/change_tier \
-u admin_username:admin_password \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"api_key": "your_api_key", "new_tier": "builder"}'
```

Where 'your_api_key" should be replaced by the address of a generated key. 

**Accessing The Database**

To access data stored in the database, determine if you want to access the raw transaction, price, or metadata data. For example, the price route can be accessed by running the following command: 

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/prices -H "API-Key: your_api_key"
```

Similar commands can be ran to access the raw transaction and the metadata information.
